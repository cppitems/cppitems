# Topics
## C++17 core language and standard library:
- basic concepts
- type deduction
- trivial types
- pointers / references
- value categories
- conversions
- lambdas
- operator overloading
- classes
- smart pointers
- iterators
- constant expressions
- templates
- concurrency



# Distance Learning
The lectures (Thursdays 9-11am) and discussions of the exercises will be realized in pairs using online video conferences; access links will be announced using TISS.

# Communication
- Important announcements will be made via the TISS-system. 
- Final personal time slots for the discussions will be announced via email.
- If you have urgent/important questions you can reach us at cpp@iue.tuwien.ac.at.
- Use https://chat.tuwien.ac.at/channel/360.251.WS21 for topcis/questions which are potentially relevant for others, too.

# Lecture material and exercise handouts
The lecture material and exercises will be published here:
https://cppitems.github.io/

# Exercise submission
Each student has to submit the exercises (source code) **individually** (no group submissions).
Submission is done by pushing the solution to a git-repository on https://tea.iue.tuwien.ac.at before the respective deadlines (user accounts are provided). The head of the `master` branch at the end of the submission period is considered as final submission. The names of the repositories must strictly follow this scheme:

- `ex0` for EX0
- `ex1.1`, `ex1.2`, `ex1.3` for EX1 
- `ex2.1`, `ex2.2`, `ex2.3` for EX2
- `ex3.1`, `ex3.2`, `ex3.3` for EX3

# Exercise grading
The three exercises EX1, EX2, and EX3 are graded with a maximum of 10 points each. EX0 is not graded but considered a 'hands on test' to become familiar with the submission process.
The grading will take place in pairs during a 30min online-interview for each exercise. Points will be awarded for the discussion of the exercise and for the submitted code.
You are required to have an audio **and** video supporting device for the discussion session.

# Exercise discussion time slots
Time slots for the online exercise discussion will stay fixed through the semester, e.g., each student has a fixed 30 minute slot between 2pm-7pm on Tuesdays (for EX1, EX2, EX3).

If you cannot participate in the three appointments (due to unresolvable conflicts), let us know in advance:

| Day  | Hour | Description  | 
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Tue	09.11.2021|	2pm-7pm |	EX1 online discussion (1/3 of grade)|
| Tue	30.11.2021|	2pm-7pm	|   EX2 online discussion (1/3 of grade)|
| Tue	11.01.2022|	2pm-7pm |	EX3 online discussion (1/3 of grade)|


# Overall Grade
The final grade is determined by the points achieved in EX1, EX2, and EX3; there is **no** additional final examination.
