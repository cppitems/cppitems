# Distance Learning
The lectures (Thursdays 9-11am) and "1on1" discussions of the exercises will be realized using zoom.us video conferences.

# Communication
Important announcement will be made via the TISS-system. 
If you have urgent/important questions you can reach us at cpp@iue.tuwien.ac.at.

# Lecture material and exercise handouts
The lecture material and exercises will be published here:
https://cppitems.github.io/

# Exercise submission
Each student has to submit the exercises (source code) individually (no group submissions).
Submission is done by pushing the solution to a git-repository on https://tea.iue.tuwien.ac.at before the respective deadlines (user accounts will be provided). The head of the `master` branch at the end of the submission period is considered as final submission. The names of the repositories must strictly follow this

- `ex0` for EX0
- `ex1` for EX1 
- `ex2` for EX2
- `ex3` for EX3

# Exercise grading
The three exercises EX1, EX2, and EX3 are graded with a maximum of 10 points each. EX0 is not graded but considered a 'hands on test' for the submission.
The grading happens in a "1on1" 15min zoom-interview for each exercise. Points will be rewarded for the discussion of the exercise and for the submitted code.
You are required to have a audio and video enabled during the discussion session.

# Exercise discussion time slots
To reduce organizational matters, the time slots for the 1on1 exercise discussion will stay fixed through the semester, e.g., each student has a fixed 15 minute slot between 4pm-6.30pm on Tuesdays (for EX1, EX2, EX3).

# Overall Grade
The final grade is determined by the points achieved in EX1, EX2, and EX3; there is no final examination.
