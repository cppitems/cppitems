# Hands-on session: git and CMake for EX0

This hands-on session should get you comfortable using git and CMake for EX0 and subsequent exercise submissions.

## git
Git is a **distributed** version-control system. This means a "git-server" is not (drastically) different from a "git-client" and roles are not fixed.

- Advantages over a **central** version-control system?

As a first step today, we will again guide you through cloning, configuring/editing and pushing a git repository; in our case the sources of EX0.

## CMake for EX0

All exercises in this course will be distributend in form of a git repository and are configured for using CMake. 
Today, as a second step, we will inspect the structure of EX0 and the accompanying CMake configuration.
